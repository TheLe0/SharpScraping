# SharpScraping

A Web Scraping made with .NET and Selenium Webdriver

This repository has two solutions:

* WbServer:A Blazor  application, is the default startup scaffolding WetherForecast. This was created just to use as a example to scraping.

* Scrapping: Is the solution, the application that is going to do the scrapping on the webserver.

## Configuration ##

You only need to have installed on your machine .NET 6 to run both of the applications. Just the Selenium Webdriver is on the root of the Scapping solution with the name of ```chromedrive.exe``` that the application is going to run. You must verify if you OS (this executable is only for windows) and Chome version (this is 98.0.4758.102) match with yours, if not you need to download and replace it.

For Chrome you can find on the [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) all versions to download for chrome. If you are using another browser (Firefox, Opera, Safari...) you need to find its webdriver.
